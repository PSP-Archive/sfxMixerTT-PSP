1. DESCRIPTION

Starting to program homebrew games for the PSP without access to a
SFX mixing library is a bit boring, so here is sfxMixerTT-PSP.


2. USAGE

Throw this into your PSP homebrew project, and adjust:

* Adjust and add SFX IDs to the ID list in sound.h
* Add the corresponding 44100Hz, raw, mono, 16bit samples to the
  sfxs array in sound.c.
* Remove all references to mp3player, if you are not using it.

You can have eight SFX samples playing concurrently, but feel free to
reserve more hardware channels.

Now, when your program starts, call soundInit(). And when you want
to play a SFX, call soundPlaySFX().


3. CONTACT

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at

4. TODO

* Add support for 22050Hz SFX
* Add more channels
* Optimize the mixer loop
* Add WAV loader


5. HISTORY

v1.0 (19-May-2007)
 * The initial release.
